Introduction
Welcome to the WPF Project Gallery. This project is a WPF application that serves as a gallery for showcasing various WPF-based applications. It is designed to demonstrate my capabilities in using different technologies such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), JSON APIs, and LINQ.

Features
This gallery includes nine projects:
1.	Animal Pic API: Enables the user to collect lists of images of animals from several animal picture APIs.
2.	API Hub: Enables the user to receive textual information from four different APIs.
3.	Frogger: Recreates in WPF the 80s SEGA game Frogger.
4.	Memory Game: Simulates a tabletop memory game with several deck sizes.
5.	TAKI Game: Simulates a tabletop game of TAKI with up to 4 players.
6.	Tic Tac Toe: Simulates a game of Tic Tac Toe that users can play together or against an algorithm.
7.	Prioritizer: Enables the user to create task lists and an algorithm will help the user set priorities between tasks.
8.	Fury Road: A simulated car driving game.
9.	Store Inventory: Simulates inventory and store management system connected to an API that holds both the inventory items and store employees.
Additionally, there is a User Contact feature at the top of the gallery page. It includes a button that opens a window allowing a user to view my credentials and make contact with me.

Reservations
Regarding documentation requirements we have received conflicting instructions:
1. In the project lesson, we were instructed that variable and function names serve as documentation.
2. The project instructions mention adding "documentation" without clear guidelines.
3. Upon seeking clarification, I was advised to use variable and function names as documentation and to add comments only to non-obvious functions. Upon reviewing my functions, each is named to describe its purpose clearly.
Therefore, all variables and functions have meaningful and relevant names, serving as the documentation.
