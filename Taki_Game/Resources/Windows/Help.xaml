Originally, I wanted to make all players' decks visible but only the player whose turn it was could view their deck. However, due to screen size limitations, only one deck is viewable at a time. It utilizes object-oriented programming, static classes, and custom message boxes and input boxes. The assets were taken from the original game website. The rules of the game here remain as they were in the original V1 game (the current public game version is V3)." />
