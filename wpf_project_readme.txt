Introduction
Welcome to the WPF Project Gallery. This project is a WPF application that serves as a gallery for showcasing various WPF-based applications. It is designed to demonstrate my capabilities in using different technologies such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), JSON APIs, and LINQ.

Features
This gallery includes nine projects:
1.	Animal Pic API: Enables the user to collect lists of images of animals from several animal picture APIs.
2.	API Hub: Enables the user to receive textual information from four different APIs.
3.	Frogger: Recreates in WPF the 80s SEGA game Frogger.
4.	Memory Game: Simulates a tabletop memory game with several deck sizes.
5.	TAKI Game: Simulates a tabletop game of TAKI with up to 4 players.
6.	Tic Tac Toe: Simulates a game of Tic Tac Toe that users can play together or against an algorithm.
7.	Prioritizer: Enables the user to create task lists and an algorithm will help the user set priorities between tasks.
8.	Fury Road: A simulated car driving game.
9.	Store Inventory: Simulates inventory and store management system connected to an API that holds both the inventory items and store employees.
